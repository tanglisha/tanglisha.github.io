I'm Liz, an experienced full stack engineer who loves learning. I've been working as a full stack engineer for around 20 years, most recently as a security software engineer.

We all know the technical landscape is changing, and I want to keep up! That doesn't just mean learing about machine learning from a creation standpoint, it also means figuring out how to best use it in day to day work.

In my free time I enjoy tabletop gaming and trying to keep my garden from frying to a crisp.
